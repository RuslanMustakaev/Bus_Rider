<h2>Alphabetize</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose we have the list called <code class="language-python">names</code>. Group them by the first letter and print the groups the alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Note that you only need to print the groups as lists without the key. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">['Ann']
['Jack', 'Jane']
['Michael']</code></pre><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
<b>Caution</b><br><br>
You may see errors in your code or execution results due to missing context. Donâ€™t worry about it, just write the solution and press Check.
